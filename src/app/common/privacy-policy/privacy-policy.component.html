        <p class="size-16 mb-3">Generally, you can visit Merino Services websites without providing any Personal Data
            about yourself.
            However, in order to access some parts of our websites, we may need to collect Personal Data from you. For
            instance, for downloading certain documents or registering for a webinar. Providing Personal Data to us in
            these events is voluntary. If you do not provide Personal Data to us, then you will not be able to benefit
            from the respective functionality offered by our websites, such as communication, downloading of documents
            or recruitment. The purposes, for which your Personal Data is collected, are described below.</p>
        <ul class="arrowBullet  mt-0">
            <li><strong>Marketing events: </strong>we store the data you provide us when you register for a Marketing
                Event like Webex presentations, customer meetings, newsletters and such so we can offer you access to

            <li> <strong>Website visit:</strong> we store the data you provide us when you visit our website, download

                engage with Merino for consultancy and training services so we can provide you these services.</li>

                allow you access and for security purposes</li>
